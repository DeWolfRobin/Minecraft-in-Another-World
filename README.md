# Minecraft in another world (MIAW)
This is an attempt to create a minecraft mod based on several Isekai. (My first minecraft mod)

## ToDo
### Predator abbility
>This is the first PoC, to see how I would go about this.

At first, start with an interaction with a mob:
1. Assign keybind
2. Assert if mob is targetted when keybind is pressed
3. Get name of mob

### Abillity Generation
>This is based on several isekai, where the protagonist gets random overpowered abilities.

1. Generate a huge list of abillities => ChatGPT :D
2. Assign levels/rarity to them
3. Start looking for a way to create a system, rather than implementing them one by one
4.
